        I'm a 17 year old artist based in London. My work is a diverse mix of digital and traditional media, ranging from paint, pastels, pencils to the digital world. I made this website to serve as a platform to publish my art for the world to see. It was an idea made in spite of the current state of social media, and how it is more about the brands, businesses and algorithms rather than the individual.
